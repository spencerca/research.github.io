<td><b>Background Info</b></td>
<td>Cyberbullying can take place within the use of technology. This is very broad as technology can mean several examples such as social media, messaging platforms, gaming platforms and anything on phones. (UNICEF 1)
 Examples of it on social media include popular platforms like Facebook, Instagram, TikTok, Snapchat and Twitter. What exactly happens is quite different than bullying in person. 
A bully could do things such a spread lies about a person and/or post embarrassing photos or videos of the person. 
A bully might send hurtful messages or even post threatening videos to the victim. 
 A bully could even go as far as to create a fake account of someone.</td>
<tr>
<td><b>Current Evidence</b></td>
<td>2)	According to the National Center for Education Statistics, 20.2% percent of all students have reported experience with some kind of bullying.
3)	Another National Center for Education Statistics study published in 2020 reports that about 15% of students between the ages of 12 and 18 had been a victim of cyberbullying within a 12-month period.
4)	Youth who are part of the LGBTQ community are significantly more likely to experience cyberbullying. This study by the Cyberbullying Research Center found that 56% of students who identified as LGBTQ had experienced cyberbullying compared to just about a third of non-LGBTQ students.
5)	The Cyberbullying Research Center also found that about 16% of students had cyberbullied others at some point in their lifetime.
6)	Admissionsly notes that about 5.1% of students have bullied others in some way or form as of 2020.
7)	Teachers listed cyberbullying as the top online issue for students in a survey by Google, ahead of privacy, inappropriate content, and other concerns.
8)	The consequences of cyberbullying can be substantial for both the bullied and the bullies, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).
